        <h2>Decentralized Science (DeSci)</h2>
        <p>DeSci is revolutionizing research with blockchain for a more open, collaborative, and equitable ecosystem. [cite: 1] It aims to address the limitations of traditional funding and research models by fostering transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. [cite: 14, 15, 16] DeSci DAOs are a key component of this movement, offering a new way to organize and fund scientific projects. [cite: 2]
        </p>
        <h2>Traditional Research Challenges</h2>
        <p>Traditional scientific research faces challenges like limited funding, restricted data access, and slow publication processes. [cite: 3, 5, 6] The "valley of death" in funding for biomedical science describes the point between academic research and clinical development, where significant findings may be lost without funding. [cite: 3, 7] Data discoverability is also challenging due to complex data repositories that are cumbersome and require understanding copyrights and IP licensing. [cite: 3, 8]
        </p>
        <h2>DeSci Solutions</h2>
        <p>DeSci leverages blockchain technology and decentralized tools to address these issues and create a more efficient and accessible scientific ecosystem. [cite: 6, 9] It aims to address the misalignment of incentives in academic research, emphasizing transparency, rapid funding, and open-source principles. [cite: 7, 10, 11]
